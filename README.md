## What

This plugin adds support for Fe to Hardhat. Once installed, Fe contracts can be compiled by running the `compile` task.

This plugin plans to generate the same artifact format as the built-in Solidity compiler, so that it can be used in conjunction with all other plugins.

The Fe compiler is run using the [official binary releases](https://github.com/ethereum/fe/releases).

## Installation

First, you need to install the plugin by running

```bash
npm install --save-dev @developerdao/hardhat-fe
```

And add the following statement to your `hardhat.config.js`:

```js
require("@developerdao/hardhat-fe");
```

Or, if you are using TypeScript, add this to your `hardhat.config.ts`:

```js
import "@developerdao/hardhat-fe";
```

## Required plugins

No plugins dependencies.

## Tasks

This plugin creates no additional tasks.

## Environment extensions

This plugin does not extend the Hardhat Runtime Environment.

## Configuration

This plugin adds an optional `fe` entry to Hardhat's config, which lets you specify the Fe version to use.

This is an example of how to set it:

```js
module.exports = {
  fe: {
    version: "0.17.0-alpha",
  },
};
```

Or you can use a customized compiler by specifying the path to the binary instead of downloading from official releases:

```js
module.exports = {
  fe: {
    compilerPath: "absolute_path_to_fe_compiler_binary",
  },
};
```

## Usage

There are no additional steps you need to take for this plugin to work.

## Known issues

since Fe is still under heavy development

* the abi file generated by Fe compiler does not contain `deployedBytecode` attribute
* the abi file generated by Fe compiler does not contain `stateMutability` attribute, [related issue](https://github.com/ethereum/fe/issues/557)

## Development

```
npm install // install dependencies
npm run build // build before publish
npm run test // run tests
```
